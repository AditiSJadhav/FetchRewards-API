# Fetch Rewards API
A Web service that exposes basic end-points for user registration, add, deduct and get the balance reward points for the user.

## Architecture: Framework: Spring-Boot

Data storage: In memory  
Data structures used â€“ HashMap, Array List, PriorityQueue 
- HashMap <String, Integer> - Store the Payer name and the total points for each user.
- HashMap <String, Integer> - Store the Payer name and negative value points in the `add_points` endpoint.
- PriorityQueue - Stores the Payer information(Payername, points, date). Used to access the earliest transaction first.
- ArrayList - Used to return the list of users and the remaining balances.
